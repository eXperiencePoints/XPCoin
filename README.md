Product Document: XP Coin Product Building Environment
```
**Author** : DigiWarfare/XPCoin, Tnaruto/XPCoinJP, Lexicon/XPCoin

**Version 1.0. 2**

**March 6, 2018**

**This document covers building of the Windows 10 , Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux wallets. It gives detail
and setup instructions to guide you and assist you in any issues at you may encounter. This document
will be revised periodically to contain updated to the environment and to the XPCoin software itself.**


**Part 1: Building the windows wallet**

This section will cover building the windows wallets. This will cover both the server daemon and the qt
wallet version.

**Pathing Requirements:**

PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows,
specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. In general, each executing
process or user session has its own PATH setting.

You will need to make sure these following items are added to the windows path.

1. CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package
    software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and
    compiler independent configuration files and generate native makefiles and workspaces that
    can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created
    by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-
    source projects such as ITK and VTK.


```
a. C:\Program Files\CMake\bin
```
2. devenv.exe is a process which belongs to the Microsoft Visual Studio, which is an application
    development suite from Microsoft. This program is a non-essential system process but should
    not be terminated unless suspected to be causing problems.
       a. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\ 2017 \Community\Common7\IDE


**Requirements:**

Building the wallet will require you to have the following software packages. Please make sure that you
have before compiling or running the batch files.

1. Windows 10 Pro

    a. https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-
       studio/?sku=Community&rel=
3. Chocolatey
    a. https://chocolatey.org/
4. Qt 5.10.1: Open Source (Community Version)
    a. https://www.qt.io/download
    b. Install to HD location **C:\QT**
5. Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (msvc2015 32bit)

7. GitHub CLI
    a. https://git-scm.com/download/win

**Getting the XPCoin Software:**

The next steps will have to be performed in a command shell being run as administrator

1. XPCoin GitHub: https://github.com/eXperiencePoints/XPCoin
    a. git clone https://github.com/eXperiencePoints/XPCoin
2. Add features required for build environment
    a. cd XPCoin
    b. git checkout feature/support_windows
    c. git checkout feature/add_appveyor_script
3. Installing Dependency’s: We need to install a number of build dependency’s. Please execute the
    next steps in exact order. If a step fails to build, please correct it before moving on. You can
    however start over and run all files in order. This will not affect the system as each part is
    separate or requires a previous to be built before it can. These files need to be run from a
    command shell as administrator.

```
a. execute MSVC\prepare.bat by Admin permission.
b. execute MSVC\boost.bat that downloads precompiled boost 1.66.
c. execute MSVC\openssl.bat that downloads precompiled openssl 1.0.2l
d. execute MSVC\berkeleydb.bat that downloads berkeley db 4.8.30 sources.
e. build berkeley db by using MSVC\db-4.8.30.NC\build_windows\Berkeley_DB.sln.
i. After opening solution, go to project menu and chose retarget solution. Choose
8.1 and retarget. After this, choose retarget solution again and now choose
windows 10. Once this has been done, Berkeley db will build successfully.
f. execute MSVC\qrencode.bat that downloads and compiles libqrencode. (for qt)
```

**XPd: Headless Server Wallet**

XPd is the windows server binary. It is meant to run and produce no output to the user, as it meant to be
accessed through RPC by applications.

1. execute MSVC\XPd.bat that compiles XPd.exe.
    a. This file needs to be run from a command shell as administrator.
2. C:\XPCoin\output\XPd\XPd.exe

Your environment should now be set up and ready to compile the XPCoin QT Mac Wallet.

6. `brew --prefix qt`/bin/qmake
7. make
8. `brew --prefix qt`/bin/macdeployqt XP-Qt.app -dmg


**Part 3: Debian and Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop**

**Requirements:**

Make sure system is fully patched before trying to build the ubuntu wallet.

1. Ubuntu 16.04 and64 Desktop
    a. [http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso)
    b. 4gig of memory
    c. 25 gig drive space

**Ubuntu QT Wallet Build Instructions:**

First, make sure that the required packages for Qt 5 development of your distribution are installed, these
are

1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin -y
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install git build-essential libssl-dev libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev \
    libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools

**Source Code: Get the wallet code from GitHub**

1. git clone https://github.com/eXperiencePoints/XPCoin
2. cd XPCoin
3. git checkout feature/add_appveyor_script

then execute the following two commands:


1. qmake
2. make

Alternatively, install Qt Creator and open the XP-qt.pro file.

An executable named XP-qt will be built.

If you wish to build the headless wallet you can do the following commands from inside the XPCoin/src
folder. This will produce XPd in the same directory.

```
1 make -f makefile.unix
```

**Part 4: Debug Log File:**

The debug file is created when the application is running. Please use the debug to log any errors and
please pay attention to it as it contains a lot of useful information. It will be located in the following
folder C:\Users\XPCoin\AppData\Roaming\XP\ in this build example.

As the application runs this file will grow in size. Periodically removing the file will make troubleshooting
easier. If deleted this file will regenerate on the next application start.

**Debug Log File Contents Example:**

**Part 5: XP Wallet Start Up Parameters:**

You can start the XP software with extra options. These are considered advanced features. This example
will be over the windows wallet but should still work for mac so and Linux to a good point. But your
experience may vary.

In this example we will call the wallet exe file, say where the blockchain is stored, and what XP.conf file
to read.

M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\XP-qt.exe -datadir=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain -
conf=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain\XP.conf

If we use the options -datadir and -conf we can over-ride the normal storage location, which is APPDATA
by default. It also says which XP.conf file to load.

If we wanted to run a wallet as a server, daemon, and to listen for peers we would use this example:

M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\XP-qt.exe -datadir=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain -
conf=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain\XP.conf - server -daemon -listen

Sometimes we will set application flags when we first call the wallet binary, other times we will set these
flags in the XP.conf.

In addition, it also means that we can run multiple copies of xp on a machine. We need to specify
another directory for blockchain and also have a copy of XP.conf in that folder. When running multiple
wallets on the same server you will also have to increment the ports. Each wallet running has two (2)
ports in each config.

```
1 Wallet 1
a. rpcport=
b. port=
2 Wallet 2
a. rpcport=
b. port=
```
Below we will list the full list and give a brief description of what that switch does.

**RPC Use Tips:**

Sometimes you will want to start the wallet to repair or fix transactions. These can be done by using the

- zapwallettxes command at the end of the start line.

M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\XP-qt.exe -datadir=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain -
conf=M:\Coins\scrypt\xp\blockchain\XP.conf - zapwallettxes


**Part 6: XP.conf: Configuring the Wallet**

This file is read in by the application and applied to it on load. You will need to set the RPC Username
and RPC Password to something very complex. This is very important.

If your application is not on the same server (IP Address or define a subnet) you will need to add it to the
RPC Connections section.

rpcallowip=127.0.0.
#rpcallowip=192.168.1.
#rpcallowip=192.168.1.*

This tells the wallet to allow RPC connections from this address or network.

This is an example config file (XP.conf)

rpcuser=user
rpcpassword=YDFBrMHYDFE1cK2Td
# XP.conf configuration file. Lines beginning with # are comments.
# Run on the test network instead of the real XP network.

**Part 7: Wallet RPC Calls and Console Commands:**

When using the wallet with the -server -listen commands will allow the application to use the RPC
system. These commands can also be run from the debug console in the application if available. Keep in
mind that the wallet performance will be affected by the amount of RPC calls that are happening at one
time. Avoid when possible making un-necessary wallet (RPC) calls. When possible use the function
sendmany to build and send queues of transactions rather one for each transaction.

A few key commands that can really be helpful are they addnode command and the getinfo command.

**Nodes or Peers:**

Nodes are another word for peer. These nodes/peer wallets have both in and outbound connections. As
more wallets connect and look for updated blocks, they connect to peers to get that. You can connect to
16 peers at one time and this is a wallet limit. You can add as many peers to your database as you like by
using the addnode command. Buy you will only have the ability to connect to a maximum of 16 at one
time.

Most users will not be peers. They will only contain outbound connections. So, they cannot service other
wallets looking for blockchain data. If your using tor or i2p this may not be the case as they re-route
traffic through the network bypassing any local firewall in place.

To add a node to the database, open the debug console, and type “addnode seed1.xpcoin.io add”

You can add as many nodes as you want. Just replace the address of the node for each different ip
address you want to add. You can also use the (fqdn) dns name as I have used in my example.

**RPC Wallet call result format:**

The “getinfo” rpc call returns the status of the wallet. The result returned will be a json array.

{
"version" : "XP-v1.1.0.2-bdb-msvc",
"protocolversion" : 91000,
"walletversion" : 60000,
"balance" : 5.00000000,
"unspendable" : 0.00000000,
"newmint" : 0.00000000,

"adjustedtime" : 1520643579,
"ntpoffset" : 1,
"p2poffset" : 1
},
"moneysupply" : 253602170410.47509766,
"connections" : 1,
"proxy" : "",
"ip" : "216.10.167.53",
"difficulty" : {
"proof-of-work" : 0.18135152,

"keypoolsize" : 101,
"paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
"mininput" : 0.00001000,
"errors" : ""
}

This data can be use in programming applications and api’s. Many of the types of programs or
applications developed will work through the jsonrpc process. Below is a list of wallet commands and
the example syntax in use.

**Part 8: Boot Strap File and Blockchain Updating:**

When a user builds or installs the wallet they will be required to download the blockchain. To speed up
the process we have supplied a downloadable copy of the blockchain. Download it from the following
link and extract it to the locations. Make sure the wallet is off before installing the “Boot Strap”.

Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11mCl3gtuRNDXRAwRkC-YUon7CnjwHTGB

This will be installed to different locations depending on your OS.

```
1 Windows: %APPDATA%/XP/
2 Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/XP/
3 Debian and Ubuntu Linux: ~/.XP/
```
